%%%%%%% Exemple_retop_3D_matlab_code_only.m
%%%%%%% This is a Matlab script only, which executes three major tasks :
%%%%%%% 1) Solve the Maxwell's equation for a point-dipole source (3D problem)emitting in a uniform medium (with retpoint.m)  
%%%%%%% 2) calculate the points on a box around the dipole and save their coordinates in prv_coordonnees.mat 
%%%%%%% 3) calculate the electromagnetic fields at the points on the box and send the fields into RETOP for retrieving the far-field Radiation Diagram
